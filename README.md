## About
This is some result of my MiBand3 SDK micro-RnD. I planned it for pairing and interacting with Mi Band 3 via .NET and UWP... but all experiments failed. :(

## Project Description
This project was written to interact Mi Band 3 from UWP applications.

You need installed Visual Studio with UWP on the board.

Minimum version: Windows 10.0.10586  (and 10.0.14393 for HeartRateSample project!)

## Example

HeartRateSample project included (as some Mi Band 3 showcase/example).

## State / Status of experiments

- Mi Band 3 SDK seem to be uncomplete. I detected some device connection bugs.
